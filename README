mrepo builds a local RPM repository from local ISO files, downloaded
updates and extra packages from 3rd party repositories. It takes care of
setting up the ISO files, downloading the RPMs, generating metadata
and providing PXE/TFTP resources for remote installations.

RPM packages can be download by various means using ftp, http, rsync,
reposync, sftp, RHN, ULN or YOU.

It was primarily intended for doing remote network installations of various
distributions from a laptop or USB disk without the need for CD media or
floppies, but is equally suitable for an organisation's centralized update
server.

For updating your local systems, configure either Yum, Apt, or up2date and
point them to your local mrepo server.
