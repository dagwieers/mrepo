Configuring mrepo for selinux
-----------------------------
The most simple way to make mrepo work on selinux is to map the mrepo
documentroot to the httpd context.

You can do this by doing:

	chcon -Rh --reference /var/www/html /var/www/mrepo


Another way is to create the file
/etc/selinux/targeted/src/policy/file_contexts/misc/local.fc,
with the following content:

	/var/mrepo(/.*)? system_u:object_r:httpd_sys_content_t

Afterwards recompile the policy by doing:

	make -C /etc/selinux/targeted/src load

And apply the context by doing:

	restorecon -R /var/mrepo

I'd like this to be done by default, either from the RPM package or by the
system itself. mrepo could be told to do this as well but I'm not sure if
this is the proper way to handle selinux.


Slightly more complicated selinux contribution
----------------------------------------------
David Hampton contributed a slightly more complicated selinux configuration
that defines its own mrepo objects and context, you can find those files in
the patches/ directory. SElinux improvements are welcome (as well as
information on how to standardize
