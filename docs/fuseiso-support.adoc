Integrating fuseiso with mrepo
==============================

Packages required
-----------------
dkms
~~~~
DKMS project delivers a framework where kernel dependent module source can reside 
so that it is very easy to rebuild modules as you upgrade kernels. This makes kernel 
updates easy as all the kernel dependent modules are managed by dkms and get regenerated 
in case of kernel update. Further details can be obtained at 
http://linux.dell.com/projects.shtml[homepage]

dkms-fuse
~~~~~~~~~
Fuse kernel module in dkms

fuse
~~~~
Fuse is filesystem implemented in userspace.
'With FUSE it is possible to implement a fully functional filesystem in a
userspace program.' Please look at fuse http://fuse.sourceforge.net[homepage] 
for details

fuseiso
~~~~~~~
Fuseiso is a ISO filesystem implementation in userspace using fuse backend.
Fuseiso http://fuse.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/FuseIso[homepage]


Installing Fuse and FuseIso
---------------------------
Fuse and related packages can be installed directly using the apt/yum 
from rpmforge using http://dag.wieers.com/rpm/packages/rpmforge-release/[rpmforge-release] package.
Once the rpmforge-release package is installed

    yum install dkms-fuse fuse-iso

This should pull all other dependent packages (in total 4 packages dkms, dkms-fuse, fuse, fuse-iso)

Or manually get following packages for your distro


Using dkms to install fuse kernel module
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The dkms rpm is available http://dag.wieers.com/rpm/packages/dkms/['here']

The dkms-fuse rpm is available http://dag.wieers.com/rpm/packages/dkms-fuse/['here']


Installing the fuse userspace package
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The fuse packages is available http://dag.wieers.com/rpm/packages/fuse/['here']

The fuse-iso rpm is available http://dag.wieers.com/rpm/packages/fuse-iso/['here']


Configuring Mrepo
----------------
Changes in mrepo.conf
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In '/etc/mrepo.conf' add/configure the following in the [main] section

    mountcmd = /usr/bin/fuseiso

Restart mrepo service

    service mrepo restart

This will remount all the iso images using fuseiso.
