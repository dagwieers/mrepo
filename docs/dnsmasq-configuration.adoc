Configuring dnsmasq to work with mrepo
======================================

To set up mrepo with dnsmasq, put the following lines in /etc/dnsmasq.conf:

	### Red Hat Enterprise 3 for x86
	dhcp-boot=/mrepo/rhel3as-i386/pxelinux.0,emyn,10.0.0.1

	### Fedora Core 2 for x86
	#dhcp-boot=/mrepo/fc2-i386/pxelinux.0,emyn,10.0.0.1

The syntax is:

	dhcp-boot=<path-to-pxelinux.0>,<hostname-of-tftp-server>,<ip-address-of-tftp-server>

For DNS to work, add all systems to /etc/hosts. To map a host to a fixed
IP address with DHCP, add the MAC-address and hostname/ip-address to
/etc/ethers. eg.

	/etc/hosts:
	127.0.0.1	localhost
	10.0.0.1	mrepo
	10.0.0.10	host1
	10.0.0.11	host2


	/etc/ethers:
	00:0B:1C:2D:3E:4F	host1
	00:0B:1A:29:38:47	host2

Then restart dnsmasq and make sure your systems boot using PXE.
