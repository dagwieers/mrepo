= Using rhnpush support in mrepo

This document describes how to set up a mrepo so that downloaded packages
are automatically pushed into a local Red Hat Satellite or a Spacewalk
server.


== Requirements
For rhnpush support to work, you need to have the rhnpush client installed.


== Overview
rhnpush support is handled as a metadata handler in mrepo similar to repomd
or repoview.
It will push files downloaded by mrepo through whatever supported means into
channels on a spacewalk server.


== Channel names
mrepo will build the channel name it pushes files to based on the user-
configurable rhnpushprefix, the architecture, the distribution name and the
release version.

The channel name is build in the following manner:
%{rhnpushprefix}-%{arch}-%{distribution-name}-%{release}.


== mrepo configuration
To have files pushed to to your local server you need to configure the server
and a user and password combination which is allowed to push files to the
server.

This can be set either globally in /etc/mrepo.conf or more finegrained in a
included file in the /etc/mrepo.conf.d/ directory:

---
[main]
rhnpush-server = https://localhost/APP
rhnpush-user = spacewalk
rhnpush-password = spacewalk
---

To actually use rhnpush, configure it as the sole or an additional metadata
handler as done in the example below.

---
[rhel-server-6]
name = Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server $release ($arch)
release = 6
arch = x86_64
metadata = rhnpush
rhnpushprefix = rhel

server = rhns:///rhel-$arch-server-6
server-fastrack = rhns:///rhel-$arch-server-fastrack-6
---

The example above will mirror two RHN channels, the server and the server-
fastrack channel.

These two distributions will then be pushed to the channels
rhel-x86_64-server-6 and rhel-x86_64-server-fastrack-6 respectively based
on the channel naming rules described above.

These channels need to be manually created before running mrepo.

There is an option of skipping certain channels.

---
rhnpushskip = all
---

This would skip pushing the mrepo generated .all channel to the server.
Skipping the "all" channel is activated by default but can be overwritten
by the user.
