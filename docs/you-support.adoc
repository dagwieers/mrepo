= Using YOU (Yast Online Update) support in mrepo

0.8.4svn, 19 october 2007

// Please send me improvements to this document.

This document describes how to set up a Yast Online Update mirror for
various Novell/SUSE distributions and architectures.

== Requirements
The youget python script needs cElementTree support.


== Novell update credentials for NLD9 (and alike)
To be able to download updates from update.novell.com you need to copy the
files _/etc/ximian/mcookie_ and _/etc/ximian/partnernet_ from a registered
system to your +$srcdir/$dist-$arch/+ directory.

So for NLD9, you would have eg:

    /var/mrepo/nld9-i586/mcookie
    /var/mrepo/nld9-i586/partnernet

These are used by youget to authenticate with the YOU server.


== Novell update credentials for SLES10 (and alike)
To be able to download updates from nu.novell.com you need to copy the
files _/etc/zmd/deviceid_ and _/etc/zmd/secret_ from a registered
system to your +$srcdir/$dist-$arch/+ directory.

So for SLES10, you would have eg:

    /var/mrepo/sles10-x86_64/deviceid
    /var/mrepo/sles10-x86_64/secret

These are used by youget to authenticate with the YOU server.


== YOU configuration
Having done that, you can enable multiple channels for these credentials by
adding a configuration like the one below:

----
[nld9]
name = Novell Linux Desktop $release SP3 ($arch)
release = 9
arch = i586
iso = NLD$release-SP3-$arch-CD?.iso
updates = you://update.novell.com/data/$RCE/nld9/getPackage/nld-9-$arch/
extras = you://update.novell.com/data/$RCE/nld9-extras/getPackage/nld-9-$arch/
updates-sdk = you://update.novell.com/data/$RCE/nld9-sdk/getPackage/nld-9-$arch/
----

or

----
[sles10]
name = SuSE Linux Enterprise Server $release SP1 ($arch)
release = 10
arch = i586 ia64 ppc s390x x86_64
iso = SLES-$release-SP1-$arch-CD?.iso SLES-$release-SP1-$arch-DVD?.iso
updates = you://nu.novell.com/repo/$RCE/SLES10-SP1-Updates/sles-10-$arch/
updates-sdk = you://nu.novell.com/repo/$RCE/SLE10-SDK-Updates/sles-10-$arch/
----

After that, mrepo should be able to successfully log on and download
all packages for the configured channels.


== Updates and SDK channel subscription
Before you can use the Updates or SDK channel from the Novell website, make
sure you have registered the SLES and SDK media (DVD or CD) within YaST.
Only if the +rug ca+ command returns a subscription for the updates and for
the SDK channel, it will work with mrepo:

----
system:~ # rug ca

Sub'd? | Name                                              | Service
-------+---------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------
Yes    | SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 10 SP1               | SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 10 SP1
Yes    | SUSE Linux Enterprise Software Development Kit 10 | SUSE Linux Enterprise Software Development Kit 10
Yes    | SLES10-SP1-Updates                                | https://nu.novell.com
       | SLE10-SP1-Debuginfo-Updates                       | https://nu.novell.com
Yes    | SLE10-SDK-Updates                                 | https://nu.novell.com
----


== Troubleshooting
If you have problems making one of the catalogs (channels) work, you may
have a problem with your zmd cache or zmdb. Resolution is described in
TID 3303599, 3181469 and 3818394. After following those procedures, rerun
suse_register with your Novell login and activation code, eg:

----
service novell-zmd stop
rm -f /etc/zmd/{deviceid,secret}
rm -rf /var/cache/zmd/*
service novell-zmd start
suse_register -n -a email=company@example.com -a regcode-sles=03474hdkndg3934957340
